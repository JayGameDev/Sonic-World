# Sonic-World
A boss battling based platformer (Check Releases for the game)

#This game is a hobby project I made to help myself get better at Ue4 and c++ in general.

#The Core game loop: Enter the hub world, pass through boss gate, defeat boss, rinse and repeat.
Saves and multiple endings were added for your enjoyment!

#The Source code is available for anyone to mess around with: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ETCj-OIvVo0egL_XXymMlv1S0_pbQ_fY/view
(Just don't flame me too hard for bad coding practices; Still kinda new to this type of stuff haha)
